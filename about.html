                <h3>Why Low Sodium?</h3>
                <p>Excess sodium consumption is linked to high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. The American Heart Association recommends limiting sodium to no more than 2,300 mg per day for optimal health.</p>
                <p>Our recipes are carefully crafted to keep sodium levels low without sacrificing flavor. We use fresh herbs, spices, and natural ingredients to create meals that taste amazing and support your cardiovascular health. By choosing low-sodium options, you're taking a significant step toward a longer, healthier life.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h3>Why Gluten-Free?</h3>
                <p>Whether you have celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or simply want to explore gluten-free eating, we've got you covered. Gluten-free diets can improve digestive health, increase energy levels, and reduce inflammation for many people.</p>
                <p>Our gluten-free recipes use wholesome alternatives like quinoa, rice, almond flour, and certified gluten-free oats. Each recipe is tested to ensure it's both nutritious and satisfying, so you never feel like you're missing out.</p>
